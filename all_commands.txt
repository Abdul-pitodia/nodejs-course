npm install --save express == production dependency command that installs express js

for dev, npm install --save-dev express

app = express() == express exports a function which has lot of methods to be used which ease process of backend 

app.use() == its a function that takes a function, (req, res, next) where req, res are default objects and next is a function passed so that if we use another middle ware (app.use()) we can connect to this middle ware from the previous one


app.listen() == takes a port number as argument and sets up a http server with req and res automatically

app.use('<route>', funcs) == route is the route for which function should be invoked.

app.use('/', funcs) == here / basically means the route starts from slash.
however we have multiple routes that all start with a slash. we do not want this middle ware to be invoked for lets say, /product-info because we have another page for it
so we want to have if - else type situation that for this route invoke this , or that. 
for this we will not use "next()" as it connects two or more middleware.
the request is parsed from top to bottom, so we want to keep pages in the top and / at bottom
next() should only be used before sending a response because we want all things connnceted by middle ware first and then finally sending responses.


npm install --save body-parser == this parses incoming requests (text type not all type) and this is also a middle ware that auto invokes next function, however we keep this above everything as we need to parse urls anyway


to trigger for a get or post request, use

app.post()
or app.get() this is used for filtering and stuff
also , get() always exactly matches the url. so order is not imp when setting routes


res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, <path>)) == path resolves the file directory naming system depending on os and concatenates names seperated by commas. this requires path module to be imported into the app.
dirname gives absolute path to the file u are currently in. so if u wanna go up add ".." also


express.static() == helps serve static files such as css, js and images which are kept in the public folder to be accessed. these are read only.
